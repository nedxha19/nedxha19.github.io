Luckily, we’ve rounded up the top 20 brands in the world for your wardrobe essentials. While these brands each offer signature pieces, they all possess the core styles that should anchor every modern man’s closet. They range from affordable household names such as Levi’s, Nike, and J.Crew, to newer designers like Fear of God and Todd Snyder, which both offer more stylized products at a designer price point.</p>
